Themes allow you to change the look and feel of your Drupal site. You can use
themes contributed by others or create your own.

WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
--------------------------------

Placing downloaded and custom themes in this directory separates downloaded and
custom themes from Drupal core's themes. This allows Drupal core to be updated
without overwriting these files.
